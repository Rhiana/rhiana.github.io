			<h3 class="grid_2 alpha">26th of August 2013: Reflection</h3>
			<p class="grid_8 omega first">A few weeks ago I decided to learn how to code. This was not a sudden decision, I have always had an affinity to computers, but a difficult one all the same as it would mean giving up work whilst diving into self-directed teaching of a new and complicated set of skills.<br> My husband was a wealth of resources and enthusiasm and set me up with a number of teaching websites and coding groups to get me started and offering on-going support as needed. However it didn't seem to take me long to grasp the basics of html and css. While it takes a bit of trial and error to make something yourself from scratch, I find it very liberating to be able to read and learn coding. It also makes it easier to follow certain conversation topics that inevitably crop up when you are married to a programmer.<br> Still I believe I have learnt fast, and hopefully well, and look forward to future learning. In particular I will be working on this website, adding features and tweaking code parallel to learning features in order to consolidate my learning.</p>

			<p class="grid_8 omega first"> I'm finishing up on HTML and CSS and have started to learn JavaScript. It is a tricky language I have discovered, it seems simple on face value and when you read it, but trying to get it to do something specific is quite tricky. Daniel advised that I start studying &quot;Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs&quot;. I'm plesently surprised by how much it makes sense and how well it is written and think learning JavaScript along side of this will be very complementary. <br> I was also very happy today to receive a sponsered ticket to Rails Camp for November. I am looking forward to the Ruby installfest before this in October which should go well together and go a long way towards me learning Ruby which is my goal by the end of the year.
